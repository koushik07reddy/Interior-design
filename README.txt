SPECIFICATIONS OF THE PROJECT:
 The project is a website which demonstrates the portfolio of an interior designing firm. It shows the various details such as the employees of the company, the designs which are available, pricing of the services, and a page to allow the user to contact the firm.

 The project was designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and bootsrap, and nodeJS and MySQL were used to implement the backend. Most of the designing was done from scratch, some elements were referred by other similar websites.

 The various webpages in the project are: 

  <-> index.html          -->  The homepage of the website.
  <-> services.html       -->  This page displays the various services offered by the firm.
  <-> aboutus.html        -->  This page shows a brief detail about the mission of the firm.
  <-> portfolio.html      -->  This page displays the various designs that are available.
  <-> contactus.html      -->  This page provides a form to contact the firm. It also shows a location of a retail store of the firm.


 NodeJS and MySQL were used to implement the backend part of the project. The database used is named 'ContactDB' and it contains a table named 'accounts' which stores the details and the message sent from contactus.html webpage. The database can be imported to the localhost MySQL client using the commands in the sql_commands.txt.

 To host the website on localhost, run the command 'node app.js' in the root directory of the project. Then you'll be able to access the website on 'localhost:3000' using a web browser.
